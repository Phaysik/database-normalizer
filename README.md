# database-normalizer

Normalize databases up to 5NF based on a SQL dataset and the functional dependencies

## Program Requirements

Run the makefileDependencies file to determine installation steps

```bash
    bash makefileDependencies.sh
```

## Important Note Regarding the Makefile

Do not change any of the variables in the Makefile as it may cause the executable to segfault.

### Breakdown of each Makefile command

| Command                    | Action           |
| -------                    | -----------      |
| compile                    | Runs the create_folders command. Creates an executable in the output folder. Copies resource folder to the output folder. |
| run                        | Runs the compile command. Runs the executable in the output folder. |
| debug                      | Creates an executable in the output folder with debugging information in the compiled code. |
| valgrind                   | Runs the debug command. Runs a memory checker on the executable in the output folder to see if there is any memory leaks. |
| delete_lcov                | Delete any \*.gcno, \*.gcda, and \*.info files associated with the lcov command. |
| copy_and_run_test          | Copies the resource folder to the output folder. Copies and runs the test executable from the test folder to the output folder. |
| build_test                 | Runs the create_folders and delete_lcov commands. Compiles a test executable with Google Test flags. Runs the copy_and_test command. |
| lcov                       | Runs the build_test command. Creates lcov files on the entire codebase. Then removes the lcov files associated with the lcov folder. |
| genhtml                    | Runs the lcov command. Deletes and recreates the genhtml output folder. Creates a set of web pages to view the code coverage of the codebase in the genhtml output folder. |
| coverage                   | Runs the genhtml command. Deletes the test output and lcov output folders. |
| tidy_setup                 | Creates a clang tidy config file based on allowed and disallowed checks. |
| fix_tidy_warnings          | Replace certain values in the clang tidy file that are erroneously created during tidy_setup. |
| tidy                       | Runs the tidy_setup and fix_tidy_warnings commands. Runs clang tidy on the code base. |
| create_doxygen             | Creates a Doxygen config file. |
| change_doxygen_options     | Runs the create_doxygen command. Changes the default values of the Doxygen config file. |
| create_breathe_file        | Creates the breathe config file for sphinx. |
| create_index_rst_file      | Creates the index.rst file which displays the sphinx docs. |
| determine_index_rst_exists | Runs the create_breathe_file commands. Checks if index.rst exists and if it doesn't it runs the create_index_rst_file command. |
| doxygen_complete           | Runs the change_doxygen_options command. Runs the doxygen config file and then deletes the .bak that is created. |
| docs                       | Runs the doxygen_complete and determine_index_rst_exists commands. Uses sphinx to build the docs from the Doxygen XML output. |
| create_folders             | Creates the boilerplate folders for running other commands. Does not need to be executed individually. |

### Input files

This program assumes the input files are all **valid**

#### SQL Dataset files

- The input .sql files **must** be stored in resources/sql/
- These files **must** be valid MySQL syntax

#### Functional Dependency files

- The input .txt files **must** be stored in resources/dependencies/
- These files **must** be valid functional dependencies based on the SQL Dataset files

#### Running the code

- For running the code

```bash
    make run
```

- For running the test suite

```bash
    make coverage
```

- For checking memory leaks

```bash
    make valgrind
```

- For creating the documentation

```bash
    make docs
```

- For checking linting

```bash
    make tidy
```
